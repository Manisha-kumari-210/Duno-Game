# Dino Game – Console-based Hurdle Game

A simple console-based hurdle game developed in C, where the player controls a dinosaur that jumps over moving obstacles. It features progressive difficulty, score tracking, and basic gameplay mechanics using ASCII art. It’s a fun way to practice programming and game development in C.

## Features:
- **Dynamic Obstacles**: Moving obstacles that the player must jump over.
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Speed of obstacles increases as the game progresses.
- **Jumping Mechanics**: Dinosaur jumps over obstacles when the space bar is pressed.
- **Score Tracking**: Tracks the score based on how long the player survives.
- **Game Over**: Game ends if the dinosaur collides with an obstacle.
- **Exit Option**: Player can exit the game anytime by pressing 'X'.

## Technologies:
- **C Programming**: Written in C.
- **ASCII Art**: Dinosaur and obstacles represented using ASCII characters.
- **Windows Console**: Uses Windows API functions (`SetConsoleCursorPosition` and `GetStdHandle`) to control cursor and display output.
- **Game Mechanics**: Includes jump height control, collision detection, and obstacle movement.

## How to Play:
- **Run the Program**: Compile and run the Dino Game in any C compiler that supports `conio.h` and Windows-specific functions.
- **Control the Dinosaur**:
  - **Space Bar**: Makes the dinosaur jump to avoid obstacles.
  - **X**: Exits the game.
- **Goal**: Survive as long as possible by jumping over obstacles. Score increases as you avoid obstacles.

## How to Run:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/duno-game.git
2. Open the project in your preferred C compiler or IDE (e.g., Code::Blocks or Visual Studio).
Compile the duno.c file and run the program.
