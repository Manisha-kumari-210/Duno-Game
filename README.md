A simple console-based hurdle game developed in C, where the player controls a dinosaur that jumps over moving obstacles. It features progressive difficulty, score tracking, and basic gameplay mechanics using ASCII art. It’s a fun way to practice programming and game development in C.

Features:
Dynamic Obstacles: Moving obstacles that the player must jump over.
Progressive Difficulty: Speed of obstacles increases as the game progresses.
Jumping Mechanics: Dinosaur jumps over obstacles when the space bar is pressed.
Score Tracking: Tracks the score based on how long the player survives.
Game Over: Game ends if the dinosaur collides with an obstacle.
Exit Option: Player can exit the game anytime by pressing 'X'.
Technologies:
C Programming: Written in C.
ASCII Art: Dinosaur and obstacles represented using ASCII characters.
Windows Console: Uses Windows API functions (SetConsoleCursorPosition and GetStdHandle) to control cursor and display output.
Game Mechanics: Includes jump height control, collision detection, and obstacle movement.
How to Play:
Run the Program: Compile and run the Dino Game in any C compiler that supports conio.h and Windows-specific functions.
